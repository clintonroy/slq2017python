** Introduction to Myself
  * I've run the local user group for years
  * I've run the Australian python conference in Brisbane twice, helped out
    in other cities
  * Help out at many Open Source and Open Data events.


* Fundamental Programming Concepts
** Fundamental Programming Concepts
 * Computers run a lot of tiny steps very quickly.
 * Most programming comes down to organising steps:
  1. Doing one step after another
  2. Repeating steps
  3. Choosing between two steps
  4. Grouping steps

* Fundamental Python Concepts
** Fundamental Python Concepts
 * Everything is an object
 * Some objects change, some objects don't
 * Easy to use data structures
 * Takes care of a lot of details for you
 * Designed to be a learning language
 * Low cognitive load, lets you work on your problem

* Python Details
 * Professional programming language used all over the world in many
   industries
 * It's Open Source, your skills are portable.
 * There are lots of implementations of Python, we're only looking at one
 * Comes with Linux. Older versions come bundled with Apple. Easyish to install on Windows.

* Grouping Steps
** Grouping of steps
 * functions
 * classes
 * files
 * libraries

** Data Structures

* Python data structures
  * atoms: strings, numbers
  * molecules: tuples, lists, dictionaries
